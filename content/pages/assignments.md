Students are graded on the following three assignments.

Assignment 1: Class Participation
---------------------------------

Each week, everyone reads the general readings, as well as one or more key readings from the subtopics for that week's lectures, in preparation for a class discussion. The readings are listed by subtopic in the {{% resource_link 5b6602a8-2c9c-a805-a413-039bbc00dc35 "readings" %}} section.

Assignment 2: Presentation of Readings
--------------------------------------

In each class, one student is assigned to present the readings on collateral or challenging evidence and points of view, and they present this material over the course of the discussion. Students are expected to be able to critically challenge the readings, and to provide evidence for their contrary or supporting view of the readings.

Assignment 3: Final Paper
-------------------------

A ten-page paper is due at the end of the course. Students select a topic which can be based on the assigned readings or other sources. The paper summarizes the research contained in the source material as well as the student's critical analysis of the work.
